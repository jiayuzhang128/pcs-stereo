# pcs-stereo

This repository is code for our paper "Proxy-supervised Cross-spectral Stereo Matching"

The pipeline of our method is as follows:

![pipeline](https://github.com/jiayuzhang128/pcs-stereo/blob/master/imgs/overall.png)

## Enviroment

Our experiments were conducted in the following environments:

+ Nvidia GForce 3090 * 1

+ Ubuntu 18.04

+ Python 3.8

+ Pytorch

For detailed environment configuration, please refer to `requirements.txt`

### special dependency installation

```bash
pip install 'git+https://github.com/saadnaeem-dev/pytorch-linear-warmup-cosine-annealing-warm-restarts-weight-decay'
```

## Data preparation

We use `Pittsburgh` cross-spectrial stereo dataset, please refer to [DMC](https://github.com/tiancheng-zhi/cs-stereo) for downloading.

To generate **dense pseudo-labels**ï¼Œ please first follow the steps in the paper to generate initial labels using [Metric3D](https://github.com/YvanYin/Metric3D) and [CREStereo](https://github.com/ibaiGorordo/CREStereo-Pytorch), then refer to our code in `pseudo_label_generation` folder.

more qualitative results of our **pseudo-label generation** method are shown in `imgs/results.pdf`.
